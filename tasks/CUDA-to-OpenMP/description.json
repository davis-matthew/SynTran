        "input" : "\n            3.1. Kernels: CUDA C++ extends C++ by allowing the programmer to define C++ functions, called kernels, that, when called, are executed N times in parallel by N different CUDA threads, as opposed to only once like regular C++ functions.\n\nA kernel is defined using the __global__ declaration specifier and the number of CUDA threads that execute that kernel for a given kernel call is specified using a new <<<...>>> execution configuration syntax. Each thread that executes the kernel is given a unique thread ID that is accessible within the kernel through built-in variables.\n\nAs an illustration, the following sample code, using the built-in variable threadIdx, adds two vectors A and B of size N and stores the result into vector C.\n\n// Kernel definition\n__global__ void VecAdd(float* A, float* B, float* C)\n{\n    int i = threadIdx.x;\n    C[i] = A[i] + B[i];\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    ...\n    // Kernel invocation with N threads\n    VecAdd<<<1, N>>>(A, B, C);\n    ...\n}\nHere, each of the N threads that execute VecAdd() performs one pair-wise addition.\n\n3.2. Thread Hierarchy: For convenience, threadIdx is a 3-component vector, so that threads can be identified using a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional thread index, forming a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional block of threads, called a thread block. This provides a natural way to invoke computation across the elements in a domain such as a vector, matrix, or volume.\n\nThe index of a thread and its thread ID relate to each other in a straightforward way: For a one-dimensional block, they are the same; for a two-dimensional block of size (Dx, Dy), the thread ID of a thread of index (x, y) is (x + y Dx); for a three-dimensional block of size (Dx, Dy, Dz), the thread ID of a thread of index (x, y, z) is (x + y Dx + z Dx Dy).\n\nAs an example, the following code adds two matrices A and B of size NxN and stores the result into matrix C.\n\n// Kernel definition\n__global__ void MatAdd(float A[N][N], float B[N][N],\n                       float C[N][N])\n{\n    int i = threadIdx.x;\n    int j = threadIdx.y;\n    C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j];\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    ...\n    // Kernel invocation with one block of N * N * 1 threads\n    int numBlocks = 1;\n    dim3 threadsPerBlock(N, N);\n    MatAdd<<<numBlocks, threadsPerBlock>>>(A, B, C);\n    ...\n}\nThere is a limit to the number of threads per block, since all threads of a block are expected to reside on the same streaming multiprocessor core and must share the limited memory resources of that core. On current GPUs, a thread block may contain up to 1024 threads.\n\nHowever, a kernel can be executed by multiple equally-shaped thread blocks, so that the total number of threads is equal to the number of threads per block times the number of blocks.\n\nBlocks are organized into a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional grid of thread blocks. The number of thread blocks in a grid is usually dictated by the size of the data being processed, which typically exceeds the number of processors in the system.\n\nThe number of threads per block and the number of blocks per grid specified in the <<<...>>> syntax can be of type int or dim3. Two-dimensional blocks or grids can be specified as in the example above.\n\nEach block within the grid can be identified by a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional unique index accessible within the kernel through the built-in blockIdx variable. The dimension of the thread block is accessible within the kernel through the built-in blockDim variable.\n\nExtending the previous MatAdd() example to handle multiple blocks, the code becomes as follows.\n\n// Kernel definition\n__global__ void MatAdd(float A[N][N], float B[N][N],\nfloat C[N][N])\n{\n    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n    int j = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;\n    if (i < N && j < N)\n        C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j];\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    ...\n    // Kernel invocation\n    dim3 threadsPerBlock(16, 16);\n    dim3 numBlocks(N / threadsPerBlock.x, N / threadsPerBlock.y);\n    MatAdd<<<numBlocks, threadsPerBlock>>>(A, B, C);\n    ...\n}\nA thread block size of 16x16 (256 threads), although arbitrary in this case, is a common choice. The grid is created with enough blocks to have one thread per matrix element as before. For simplicity, this example assumes that the number of threads per grid in each dimension is evenly divisible by the number of threads per block in that dimension, although that need not be the case.\n\nThread blocks are required to execute independently. It must be possible to execute blocks in any order, in parallel or in series. This independence requirement allows thread blocks to be scheduled in any order and across any number of cores as illustrated by Figure 3, enabling programmers to write code that scales with the number of cores.\n\nThreads within a block can cooperate by sharing data through some shared memory and by synchronizing their execution to coordinate memory accesses. More precisely, one can specify synchronization points in the kernel by calling the __syncthreads() intrinsic function; __syncthreads() acts as a barrier at which all threads in the block must wait before any is allowed to proceed. Shared Memory gives an example of using shared memory. In addition to __syncthreads(), the Cooperative Groups API provides a rich set of thread-synchronization primitives.\n\nFor efficient cooperation, shared memory is expected to be a low-latency memory near each processor core (much like an L1 cache) and __syncthreads() is expected to be lightweight.\n\n3.2.1. Thread Block Clusters\nWith the introduction of NVIDIA Compute Capability 9.0, the CUDA programming model introduces an optional level of hierarchy called Thread Block Clusters that are made up of thread blocks. Similar to how threads in a thread block are guaranteed to be co-scheduled on a streaming multiprocessor, thread blocks in a cluster are also guaranteed to be co-scheduled on a GPU Processing Cluster (GPC) in the GPU.\n\nSimilar to thread blocks, clusters are also organized into a one-dimension, two-dimension, or three-dimension grid of thread block clusters as illustrated by Figure 5. The number of thread blocks in a cluster can be user-defined, and a maximum of 8 thread blocks in a cluster is supported as a portable cluster size in CUDA. Note that on GPU hardware or MIG configurations which are too small to support 8 multiprocessors the maximum cluster size will be reduced accordingly. Identification of these smaller configurations, as well as of larger configurations supporting a thread block cluster size beyond 8, is architecture-specific and can be queried using the cudaOccupancyMaxPotentialClusterSize API.\n\nGrid of Thread Block Clusters\nFigure 5 Grid of Thread Block Clusters\n\nNote\n\nIn a kernel launched using cluster support, the gridDim variable still denotes the size in terms of number of thread blocks, for compatibility purposes. The rank of a block in a cluster can be found using the Cluster Group API.\n\nA thread block cluster can be enabled in a kernel either using a compile-time kernel attribute using __cluster_dims__(X,Y,Z) or using the CUDA kernel launch API cudaLaunchKernelEx. The example below shows how to launch a cluster using a compile-time kernel attribute. The cluster size using kernel attribute is fixed at compile time and then the kernel can be launched using the classical <<< , >>>. If a kernel uses compile-time cluster size, the cluster size cannot be modified when launching the kernel.\n\n// Kernel definition\n// Compile time cluster size 2 in X-dimension and 1 in Y and Z dimension\n__global__ void __cluster_dims__(2, 1, 1) cluster_kernel(float *input, float* output)\n{\n\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    float *input, *output;\n    // Kernel invocation with compile time cluster size\n    dim3 threadsPerBlock(16, 16);\n    dim3 numBlocks(N / threadsPerBlock.x, N / threadsPerBlock.y);\n\n    // The grid dimension is not affected by cluster launch, and is still enumerated\n    // using number of blocks.\n    // The grid dimension must be a multiple of cluster size.\n    cluster_kernel<<<numBlocks, threadsPerBlock>>>(input, output);\n}\nA thread block cluster size can also be set at runtime and the kernel can be launched using the CUDA kernel launch API cudaLaunchKernelEx. The code example below shows how to launch a cluster kernel using the extensible API.\n\n// Kernel definition\n// No compile time attribute attached to the kernel\n__global__ void cluster_kernel(float *input, float* output)\n{\n\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    float *input, *output;\n    dim3 threadsPerBlock(16, 16);\n    dim3 numBlocks(N / threadsPerBlock.x, N / threadsPerBlock.y);\n\n    // Kernel invocation with runtime cluster size\n    {\n        cudaLaunchConfig_t config = {0};\n        // The grid dimension is not affected by cluster launch, and is still enumerated\n        // using number of blocks.\n        // The grid dimension should be a multiple of cluster size.\n        config.gridDim = numBlocks;\n        config.blockDim = threadsPerBlock;\n\n        cudaLaunchAttribute attribute[1];\n        attribute[0].id = cudaLaunchAttributeClusterDimension;\n        attribute[0].val.clusterDim.x = 2; // Cluster size in X-dimension\n        attribute[0].val.clusterDim.y = 1;\n        attribute[0].val.clusterDim.z = 1;\n        config.attrs = attribute;\n        config.numAttrs = 1;\n\n        cudaLaunchKernelEx(&config, cluster_kernel, input, output);\n    }\n}\nIn GPUs with compute capability 9.0, all the thread blocks in the cluster are guaranteed to be co-scheduled on a single GPU Processing Cluster (GPC) and allow thread blocks in the cluster to perform hardware-supported synchronization using the Cluster Group API cluster.sync(). Cluster group also provides member functions to query cluster group size in terms of number of threads or number of blocks using num_threads() and num_blocks() API respectively. The rank of a thread or block in the cluster group can be queried using dim_threads() and dim_blocks() API respectively.\n\nThread blocks that belong to a cluster have access to the Distributed Shared Memory. Thread blocks in a cluster have the ability to read, write, and perform atomics to any address in the distributed shared memory. Distributed Shared Memory gives an example of performing histograms in distributed shared memory.\n\n3.3. Memory Hierarchy\nCUDA threads may access data from multiple memory spaces during their execution as illustrated by Figure 6. Each thread has private local memory. Each thread block has shared memory visible to all threads of the block and with the same lifetime as the block. Thread blocks in a thread block cluster can perform read, write, and atomics operations on each other’s shared memory. All threads have access to the same global memory.\n\nThere are also two additional read-only memory spaces accessible by all threads: the constant and texture memory spaces. The global, constant, and texture memory spaces are optimized for different memory usages (see Device Memory Accesses). Texture memory also offers different addressing modes, as well as data filtering, for some specific data formats (see Texture and Surface Memory).\n\nThe global, constant, and texture memory spaces are persistent across kernel launches by the same application.\n\nMemory Hierarchy\nFigure 6 Memory Hierarchy\n\n3.4. Heterogeneous Programming\nAs illustrated by Figure 7, the CUDA programming model assumes that the CUDA threads execute on a physically separate device that operates as a coprocessor to the host running the C++ program. This is the case, for example, when the kernels execute on a GPU and the rest of the C++ program executes on a CPU.\n\nThe CUDA programming model also assumes that both the host and the device maintain their own separate memory spaces in DRAM, referred to as host memory and device memory, respectively. Therefore, a program manages the global, constant, and texture memory spaces visible to kernels through calls to the CUDA runtime (described in Programming Interface). This includes device memory allocation and deallocation as well as data transfer between host and device memory.\n\nUnified Memory provides managed memory to bridge the host and device memory spaces. Managed memory is accessible from all CPUs and GPUs in the system as a single, coherent memory image with a common address space. This capability enables oversubscription of device memory and can greatly simplify the task of porting applications by eliminating the need to explicitly mirror data on host and device. See Unified Memory Programming for an introduction to Unified Memory.\n\nHeterogeneous Programming\nFigure 7 Heterogeneous Programming\n\nNote\n\nSerial code executes on the host while parallel code executes on the device.\n\n3.5. Asynchronous SIMT Programming Model\nIn the CUDA programming model a thread is the lowest level of abstraction for doing a computation or a memory operation. Starting with devices based on the NVIDIA Ampere GPU Architecture, the CUDA programming model provides acceleration to memory operations via the asynchronous programming model. The asynchronous programming model defines the behavior of asynchronous operations with respect to CUDA threads.\n\nThe asynchronous programming model defines the behavior of Asynchronous Barrier for synchronization between CUDA threads. The model also explains and defines how cuda::memcpy_async can be used to move data asynchronously from global memory while computing in the GPU.\n\n3.5.1. Asynchronous Operations\nAn asynchronous operation is defined as an operation that is initiated by a CUDA thread and is executed asynchronously as-if by another thread. In a well formed program one or more CUDA threads synchronize with the asynchronous operation. The CUDA thread that initiated the asynchronous operation is not required to be among the synchronizing threads.\n\nSuch an asynchronous thread (an as-if thread) is always associated with the CUDA thread that initiated the asynchronous operation. An asynchronous operation uses a synchronization object to synchronize the completion of the operation. Such a synchronization object can be explicitly managed by a user (e.g., cuda::memcpy_async) or implicitly managed within a library (e.g., cooperative_groups::memcpy_async).\n\nA synchronization object could be a cuda::barrier or a cuda::pipeline. These objects are explained in detail in Asynchronous Barrier and Asynchronous Data Copies using cuda::pipeline. These synchronization objects can be used at different thread scopes. A scope defines the set of threads that may use the synchronization object to synchronize with the asynchronous operation. The following table defines the thread scopes available in CUDA C++ and the threads that can be synchronized with each.\n\nThread Scope\n\nDescription\n\ncuda::thread_scope::thread_scope_thread\n\nOnly the CUDA thread which initiated asynchronous operations synchronizes.\n\ncuda::thread_scope::thread_scope_block\n\nAll or any CUDA threads within the same thread block as the initiating thread synchronizes.\n\ncuda::thread_scope::thread_scope_device\n\nAll or any CUDA threads in the same GPU device as the initiating thread synchronizes.\n\ncuda::thread_scope::thread_scope_system\n\nAll or any CUDA or CPU threads in the same system as the initiating thread synchronizes.\n\nThese thread scopes are implemented as extensions to standard C++ in the CUDA Standard C++ library.\n\n3.6. Compute Capability\nThe compute capability of a device is represented by a version number, also sometimes called its “SM version”. This version number identifies the features supported by the GPU hardware and is used by applications at runtime to determine which hardware features and/or instructions are available on the present GPU.\n\nThe compute capability comprises a major revision number X and a minor revision number Y and is denoted by X.Y.\n\nThe major revision number indicates the core GPU architecture of a device. Devices with the same major revision number share the same fundamental architecture. The table below lists the major revision numbers corresponding to each NVIDIA GPU architecture.\n\nTable 2 GPU Architecture and Major Revision Numbers\nMajor Revision Number\n\nNVIDIA GPU Architecture\n\n9\n\nNVIDIA Hopper GPU Architecture\n\n8\n\nNVIDIA Ampere GPU Architecture\n\n7\n\nNVIDIA Volta GPU Architecture\n\n6\n\nNVIDIA Pascal GPU Architecture\n\n5\n\nNVIDIA Maxwell GPU Architecture\n\n3\n\nNVIDIA Kepler GPU Architecture\n\nThe minor revision number corresponds to an incremental improvement to the core architecture, possibly including new features.\n\nTable 3 Incremental Updates in GPU Architectures\nCompute Capability\n\nNVIDIA GPU Architecture\n\nBased On\n\n7.5\n\nNVIDIA Turing GPU Architecture\n\nNVIDIA Volta GPU Architecture\n\nCUDA-Enabled GPUs lists of all CUDA-enabled devices along with their compute capability. Compute Capabilities gives the technical specifications of each compute capability.\n\nNote\n\nThe compute capability version of a particular GPU should not be confused with the CUDA version (for example, CUDA 7.5, CUDA 8, CUDA 9), which is the version of the CUDA software platform. The CUDA platform is used by application developers to create applications that run on many generations of GPU architectures, including future GPU architectures yet to be invented. While new versions of the CUDA platform often add native support for a new GPU architecture by supporting the compute capability version of that architecture, new versions of the CUDA platform typically also include software features that are independent of hardware generation.\n\nThe Tesla and Fermi architectures are no longer supported starting with CUDA 7.0 and CUDA 9.0, respectively.\n",
