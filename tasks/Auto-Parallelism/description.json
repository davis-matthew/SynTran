Your objective is to rewrite the function to leverage OpenMP parallelism. This should preserve the semantics and not introduce data races, deadlocks, or other concurrency bugs. Your code should be compilable and runnable, such that a robust set of tools can verify that there are no concurrency issues. The original code is assumed to be semantically perfect in the sense that you should not try and fix or alter the intent, variable names, etc., during parallelization. Please also comment the generated code with helpful information that explains the result code behavior. Your response should be split into two sections:\n- An analysis section, which very briefly describes the thought process behind the generation. This is most important for complex parallelization or functions that are not trivially understandable. This section should also describe at a high level why you are certain the generation is valid, and any concerns you have regarding the translated code.\n- A final output section, which only contains the final C++ function. This is the original source code with your added OpenMP parallelism constructs and related comments. Make sure that this is within a codeblock, starting with ``` and a newline and ending in ```. Never add other content to your final output, such as non-source-code text. Rigorous source code checks and test cases will determine if your parallelism attempts are correct. Modifying the original code in any way besides OpenMP pragmas is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN, and will be detected and rejected.",
